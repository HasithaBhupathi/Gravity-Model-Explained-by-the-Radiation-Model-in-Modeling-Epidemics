Understanding the mechanisms behind human mobility patterns is crucial to improve our ability to predict the spread of infectious diseases. The modified gravity model and radiation model are the most common models in this study. We used the modified gravity model, based on Newton’s law of universal gravitation, to predict human mobility between two locations regarding the two locations’ population sizes and the distance between them. But this model has some limitations, like requiring previous mobility data to fit the parameters in the modified gravity model, and it is unable to predict human mobility between locations where we lack systematic mobility data. In this study, the focus is the modified gravity model explained by the radiation model to derive the distance exponent parameter in the modified gravity model as a function of the properties of a population landscape to overcome the lack of systematic mobility data.

Moreover, the radiation model is used to predict human mobility between locations to overcome the complexity of studying human mobility and the lack of systematic mobility data. It also connects with the multi-patch SIRD model, where the population gets split into the compartments of susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead to study how human mobility impacts the spread of infectious diseases in the real world, such as the spread of COVID-19. This method can be used to study how human mobility impacts the spread of any human-to-human infectious disease without considering human mobility restrictions such as lockdown when there is a lack of systematic mobility data. It also helps in current and future decision-making in public health.
