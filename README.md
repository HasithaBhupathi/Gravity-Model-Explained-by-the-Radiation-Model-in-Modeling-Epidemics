Understanding the mechanisms behind human mobility patterns is crucial to improve our ability to predict the spread of infectious diseases. Two representative mobility models, i.e., radiation and modified gravity models, have been extensively compared to each other until their fundamental relations are fully understood. In order to study such a relation, we first consider the heterogeneous population landscape, which is the population of each patch following the power-law probability distribution. Then the radiation model on this population landscape, which we call the radiation-on-landscape (RoL) model, is compared to the modified gravity model to understand how the distance exponent in the modified gravity model can vary according to the properties of the population landscape.

Moreover, we develop the connection between the radiation model and the multi-patch SIRD model and study how human mobility impacts the spread of infectious diseases.
